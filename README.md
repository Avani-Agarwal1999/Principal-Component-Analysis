# Principal-Component-Analysis
In this project I have implemented PCA on the famous MNIST handwritten digit database. 
I have build a classifier using the eigendigits formalism to select feature vectors to create coded samples of the digit images. 
These can be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

There are many different variants of a standard classifier to try. Some are:

        1. Hierarchical classifiers

        2. Non-standard subsets of eigenvectors

       3; Fourier-transform on images.
